there is a full stack application and there are many comman things that requires 
both front and back end like
import { z } from "zod";
export const signupInput = z.object({
    username: z.string(),
    password: z.string()
})
console.log("hi there");

export type SignupParams = z.infer<typeof signupInput>;
this is the way 
way is that there is a comman folder in which all the comman files will be present
this comman folder will be uploaded on the npm account
only upload the folder on the npm that is useful like ts file is not important
src folder is not 

add .npmignore file
vi .npmignore

ignore any file
echo "src/" > .npmignore                    
>> echo "*" >> .npmignore//not
>> echo "!dist/" >> .npmignore


npmm pack to show which file folder are present on the account


publish any folder
npm publish --access=public  

to update the version
npm version patch

install 
npm i @p434680/common 

import {xyg} from '@p434680/omman'
one error will come 
because js file will be exported but type of 
impoted thing is not found
so solution is declearation file=>types of external modules in ts

 "declaration": true
